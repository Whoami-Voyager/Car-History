        <p>The very first car was invented in 1886 by Carl Benz named the Benz Patent Motor Car, model no. 1. It was a
            single cylinder engine making less than 1 horsepower first driven in Germany.As seen in the image above,
            this first car was very primitive and cars have come a long way since then. This website mainly focuses on
            car companies that produce sports cars, but below we will go through all the different decades of cars and
            how they evolved. Click the car logos at the top of the page to explore the history of each car company.</p>

        <h1>The 1900s</h1>
        <img src="https://cdn.britannica.com/59/60459-050-FA449882/Model-T-1909.jpg" class="image" alt="Ford Model T">
        <p>Although there were almost 2 decades of car development before this one, I will start here because this is
            where the car went from a rich persons luxury to a poor persons reality. There were cars powered by
            steam and electricity, with almost 1/3 of cars sold in the early 1900s being electric before the Model T.
            Due to cheap costs of electricity and them being more powerful and quiet than gas powered cars, they were
            even more popular than they are now. The first car to hit 60 MPH was set in an electric car. With the
            introcution of the mass production line, Henry Ford created the Model T as pictured above. Introduced in
            1908, this car became one of the best selling vehicles of the 20th Century (16.5 million units produced),
            which was never surpassed in sales until volkswagen took the title in 1972, nearly 50 years after production
            of the Model T had stopped (1927). Even though the car was produced for almost another 20 years, it was in
            this decade that produced the car that made cars commonplace among the middle class. That is what makes this
            car important, creating manufacturing jobs and catapualting the automobile industry into something Benz
            could have never dreamed of.</p>

            class="image" alt="cadillac racer">
        <p>In the 1910s, it was the wild west of Cars. It is estimated around 253 American car companies were making
            cars between 1900 and 1919. After the great depression, a mere 44 remainded. Majority of the cars produced
            were made by Ford, GMC, and Chrystler. Cars produced in this decade were crude machines compared to the cars
            of today; you had to crank start them, there was no cabin heater or cooler, the cars were smelly,loud, and
            slow. There were no such thing as fast food and gas stations were just becoming an idea with a very small
            network. Most roads were often shared with horses as that was still the main way to drive somewhere and the
            interstate sytem was not yet built. The roads were dirty. Long road trips were not very comfortable or
            sometimes not even possible. This was also the decade were racing became a type of sport; in fact, the
            reason why Ford started off well was because he raced against another car company in 1901 and although the
            other driver was more experienced and was supposed to beat Ford, due to mechanical issues the other car
            broke down and Henry won the race. Racing continues even until today because of not only the thrill but the
            press and reputation that company earns from winning. So many companies like Cadillac, Bentley, Rolls-Royce,
            Mercedez-Benz, and many many more.</p>

            class="image" alt="Bugatti Type 35">
        <p>The 1920s was another decade of radical change. The roaring 20s. The electric starter was first introduced in
            a 1912 Cadillac but was widely introduced in the 1920s, making it easier for women and elderly to drive. In
            the 1910s the US government also started spending more money making a better road system, but it wasn't
            until the 1920s that we started seeing a vastly improved highway system for the US, and the beginning of the
            German Autobahn overseas. The iconic Route 66, connecting LA and Chicago, was opened in 1926, as a part of
            the United States' numbered highway system which was built using already made state and local roads. This
            was one of the first major highways and was also used in the 30s to escape the dust bowl in the midwest to
            California. In this span of time, we also saw even more major leaps technologically with German, British,
            Italian and American engineers putting out even more powerful cars than the decade before. In the 1920s we
            saw our first Supercharger, coming from a Mercedez-Benz in 1923. Bugatti Developed a supercharged inline 8
            that produced 125 horsepower for their type 35 (pictured above), an impressive feat at the time and could
            rev up to 6,000 rpms. We also saw the "Hot Rod" scene arise, where people would take their cars and mod them
            and drag race them, some of the earliest examples of the modding community.

        <p>The 1930s whas where the wheat seperated from the chaff. Earlier I mentioned how car companies were the "wild
            west". Pointing back to that, there were an estimated 253 American car companies between 1900 and 1919.
            After the great depression, there were only 44 left. Only the best and strongest companies survived, with
            any economic recession being a major killer of car companies, especially budget car production. However,
            this recession was so bad that even some of the rich had a difficult time especially since the dust bowl
            caused major supply shortages. This decade became another large leap forward in cars. Interiors became more
            luxurious and comfortable. Hydraulic brakes became commonplace for improved braking, synchromesh
            transmissions for smoother shifting, aerodyanmic bodies to increase speed and further fuel efficiency. As
            always, racing cars became even more powerful. Over the last couple of decades, many races had formed over
            the last couple of decades, the most famous ones in america being the Indiannapolis 500, Pikes Peak Hill
            Climb. The first Daytona was held in 1936. Overseas, the 24 hours of LeMans endurance race and the Italian
            and French Grand Prix's pushed manufacturers to push the limits of what their cars could do. The biggest
            ones that stuck out were Alfa Romeo, Maserati, Mercedez-Benz, Bugatti, and Auto union (now Audi). However,
            no car company could anticipate what was coming in the next decade...</p>

        <p>1939-Germany invades Poland! This was one of the first major events that caused a domino effect on the rest
            of the world. Sunday, December 7, 1941, a day that will live in infamy. both of these events spiraled what
            we know today as the Second World War, which was another major pivotal point for autmobile manufacturers.
            European car producers rushed to help, with all the German and British manufacturers rushing and changing
            their factories to produce machines of War like Tanks, Airplanes, and transportation vehicles. Rolls-Royce
            produced the Merlin engine in one of the most iconic british WW2 fighter plane, the Spitfire. The US had
            support for Europe and it's conflict, but was mostly uninvoled in the war like world war 1 until Japan
            bombed pearl harbor. Then the hornets nest got poked. Nearly every single manufacturer in the US had to turn
            their car manufacturing facilities into war machine production, making bombers, fighters, tanks ammunition,
            parachutes, first aid kits you name it. and with that industrial might, we defeated Germany and Japan in
            1945. It took many years for life to return to pre-war conditions, but once it did it became the set-up for
            the greatest autmobile decade of all time</p>
